# OCI-Layout Archive Visualizer

`olav` is the command-line interface for OCI-Layout Archive Visualizer.

It accepts an OCI layout directory or tar archive and opens a split-pane TUI for browsing layout files, previewing text/JSON blobs, inspecting layer tarballs, and exporting selected files.

Top-level JSON is prettified by default. Text previews wrap and show line numbers by default. Layer tarballs are opened asynchronously and show an extraction overlay while they are being indexed.

## Installation

```sh
go install github.com/canonical/olav/cmd/olav@latest
```

```sh
go run ./cmd/olav <oci-layout-dir-or-tarball>
```

Image sources must use explicit transport prefixes:

```sh
olav ./oci-layout
olav ./oci-layout.tar
olav oci:./oci-layout
olav oci-archive:./oci-layout.tar
olav docker://ubuntu:24.04
olav docker://ubuntu@sha256:<digest>
olav --platform linux/amd64 docker://ubuntu:24.04
olav --platform all docker://ubuntu:24.04
olav docker-daemon:ubuntu:24.04
```

For `docker://` sources, `olav` pulls the current machine platform by default. Use `--platform os/arch` or `--platform os/arch/variant` to select a specific platform. Use `--platform all` to pull and inspect the full multi-platform image index. `--platform` is rejected for `docker-daemon:` sources.

Remote and daemon images are copied into the cache as OCI layouts before opening. The cache uses `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/olav` or `~/.cache/olav`.

During image copy, `olav` prints simple progress information to stderr before entering the TUI.

Authentication uses the default containers/image locations:

- `~/.docker/config.json`
- `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json`
- `~/.config/containers/auth.json`

If authentication fails, `olav` prints a hint pointing to these paths. Login with `docker`, `podman`, or `skopeo` before retrying private images.

## Keys

- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab`: switch focus forward/backward between visible panes
- `j` / `k`: move down/up in trees or scroll focused preview
- `Space`: expand/collapse folders in tree panes, or page down in preview panes
- `Enter` / `l` / `Right`: expand or open in tree panes
- `h` / `Left`: collapse in tree panes
- `/`: search focused pane
- `n` / `N`: next/previous preview search match
- `p`: toggle raw/pretty JSON for the focused preview
- `w`: toggle wrapping for the focused preview
- `#`: toggle line numbers for the focused preview
- `z`: toggle zoom for the focused preview
- `e`: export selected file to `./olav-export/`
- `g` / `G`: jump to top/bottom
- `f`: follow selected symlink in layer file tree, or page down in previews
- `b`: page up in previews
- `Ctrl-D` / `Ctrl-U`: half-page down/up in previews
- `h` / `l` or `Left` / `Right`: horizontal scroll when preview wrapping is disabled
- `0` / `$`: jump to first/last preview column when preview wrapping is disabled
- `?`: show help
- `q`: quit

The bottom line always shows the main key help. Transient messages, search prompts, and export/open results are shown on the line above it.

## Preview Behavior

- JSON can be toggled between raw and pretty views with `p`.
- Pretty JSON is syntax-colored.
- Top-level JSON starts in pretty mode.
- Text files inside layer tarballs start in raw mode.
- Text previews wrap by default and can be toggled with `w`.
- Text previews show line numbers by default and can be toggled with `#`.
- When wrapping is disabled, use horizontal scrolling to inspect long lines.
- Press `z` while focused on a preview pane to zoom it; press `z` or `q` again to restore the split-pane layout.
- Python, shell, and YAML files are syntax-highlighted in text previews.
- Zstd-compressed files named `manifest.wall` inside layer tarballs are decompressed in memory and rendered as syntax-colored Chisel manifest JSONL.
- For Chisel manifest JSONL, `p` toggles readable separator spacing while keeping each JSONL item on one line.
- Symlinks to text files inside layer tarballs are previewed as their targets.
- Press `f` on a symlink in the layer file tree to jump to its target when it exists.

## Layer Tarballs

Layer blobs are detected from OCI media types and can be plain tar, gzip-compressed tar, or zstd-compressed tar.

When a layer is opened for the first time, `olav` indexes it in the background and shows a centered overlay:

```text
Extracting tarball.
This can take a while for large tarballs.
```

The selected OCI blob remains highlighted while extraction is running. Once indexed, the layer view shows:

- Layer metadata at the top of the right pane
- Layer file tree in the middle
- Entry details at the bottom
- A third preview pane when the selected layer entry is a text file

Non-text files inside layer tarballs show metadata only.

## Export Layout

Top-level OCI files are exported under:

```text
olav-export/oci-layout/<original OCI path>
```

Files selected inside layer tarballs are exported under:

```text
olav-export/layers/<layer blob path>/<original layer path>
```

Layer file hierarchy is preserved.

## Supported Inputs

- OCI image layout directories
- OCI image layout tar archives
- Layer blobs compressed as plain tar, gzip, or zstd

Docker `docker save` archives are intentionally not supported. Convert them to OCI layout first, for example with `skopeo`.
